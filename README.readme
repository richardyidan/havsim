havsim (Human and Autonomous Vehicle SIMulation, calibration, and optimization) is a differentiable traffic simulator for the calibration and optimization of microscopic (agent-based) traffic simulations. Build your simulation exactly how you want. Use the most advanced optimization algorithms to fit your models or find control strategies.
