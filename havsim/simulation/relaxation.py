    """Generates relaxation for a vehicle after it experiences a lane change.

    This is called directly after a vehicle changes it lane, while it still has the old value for its
    headway, and its position has not yet been updated.
    See (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08395) for an explanation of the relaxation model.
    This implements single parameter relaxation. The Vehicle attributes associated with relaxation are
        relax_parameters: float which gives the relaxation constant (units of time)
        in_relax: bool of whether or not vehicle is experiencing relaxation currently
        relax: list of floats which stores the relaxation values
        relax_start: time index (timeind) of the 0 index of relax
        relaxmem: memory of past relaxation, list of tuples of (starttime, endtime, relax)

    Args:
        veh: Vehicle to add relaxation to
        timeind: int giving the timestep of the simulation (0 indexed)
        dt: float of time unit that passes in each timestep
        relax_speed: If True, we relax leader's speed as well.

    Returns:
        None. Modifies relaxation attributes for vehicle in place.
