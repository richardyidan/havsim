    """Defines call_downstream method for Lane. keyword options control behavior of call_downstream.

    call_downstream is used instead of the cf model in order to get the acceleration in cases where there is
    no lead vehicle (e.g. because the lead vehicle has left the simulation). Essentially, call_downstream
    will determine the rate at which vehicles can exit the simulation.
    call_downstream also gets used for on-ramps/merges where you have no leader not because you are
    leaving the simulation, but rather because the lane is about to end and you need to move over.
    Lastly, if the simulation starts with no Vehicles, call_downstream will entirely determine
    The keyword arg 'method' defines the behavior of call_downstream method for a Lane.

    Args:
        method: one of 'speed', 'free', 'flow', 'free merge', 'merge'
            'speed' - Give a function which explicitly returns the speed, and we compute the acceleration.
                Options -
                time_series: function takes in timeind, returns speed

            'free' - We use the vehicle's free_cf method to update the acceleration. This is as if vehicles
            can exit the simulation as quickly as possible.
                Options -
                None.

            'flow' - We get a flow from time_series; we then use the vehicle's inverse flow method to find
            the speed corresponding to the flow
                Options -
                time_series: function takes in timeind, returns flow
                congested: whether to assume flow is in congested or free flow branch

            'free merge' - We use the vehicle's free flow method to update, unless we are getting too close
            to the end of the road, in which case we ensure the Vehicle will stop before reaching the end of
            the lane. We assume that vehicles stop as if there was a stationary lead vehicle at the end of
            the lane. This is done by creating an AnchorVehicle at the end of the lane which is used as a
            lead vehicle.
                Options -
                minacc: We always compute the vehicle's acceleration using the anchor as a leader. If the
                    vehicle has an acceleration more negative than minacc, we use the anchor as a leader.
                    otherwise, we use the vehicle's free flow method
                stopping: if 'car following', we use the strategy with minacc. if 'ballistic', we stop
                    only when it is necessary as determined by the vehicle's minimum acceleration
                self_lane: vehicle needs to stop when reaching the end of self_lane
                time_series: Can use either free flow method or time_series; we use time_series if it is
                    not None

            'merge' - This is meant to give a longitudinal update in congested conditions while on a
            bottleneck (on ramp or lane ending, where you must merge). minacc and self_lane give behavior
            the same as in 'free merge'.
                Options -
                merge_side: either 'l' or 'r' depending on which side vehicles need to merge
                target_lane: lanes vehicles need to merge into
                merge_anchor_ind: index for merge anchor in target_lane
                self_lane: if not None, the vehicle needs to stop at the end of self_lane. If None, the
                    vehicle won't stop.
                minacc: if the acceleration needed to stop is more negative than minacc, we begin to stop.
                stopping: if 'car following', we use the strategy with minacc. if 'ballistic', we stop
                    only when it is necessary as determined by the vehicle's minimum acceleration
                shift: we infer a speed based on conditions in target_lane. We do this by shifting the speed
                    of a vehicle in target_lane by shift. (e.g. shift = 1, use the speed from 1 second ago)
                time_series: if we aren't stopping at the end of self_lane,  and can't find a vehicle to infer
                    the speed from, time_series controls the behavior. If None, the vehicle uses its free cf
                    method. Otherwise, time_series specifies a speed which is used.

def increment_inflow_wrapper(method='ceql', kwargs={}):
    """Defines increment_inflow method for Lane.

    The increment_inflow method has two parts to it. First, it is responsible for determining when to add
    vehicles to the simulation. It does this by calling the Lane.get_inflow method every timestep, which
    returns the flow amount that timestep, which updates the attribute inflow_buffer. When inflow_buffer >= 1,
    it attempts to add a vehicle to the simulation. There are extra conditions required to add a vehicle,
    which are controlled by the 'method' keyword arg.
    Once it has been determined a new vehicle can be added, this function is also responsible for calling
    the initialize method of the new vehicle, adding the new vehicle with a correct leader/follower
    relationships, and also inits the next vehicle which is to be added.

    Args:
        method: One of 'ceql' (eql_inflow_congested), 'feql' (eql_inflow_free), 'seql' (eql_speed),
            'shifted' (shifted_speed_inflow), 'newell', or 'speed' (speed_inflow) - refer to those functions.
            We suggest using 'seql' method as it seems to provide the most consistent results and works in
            both congested/uncongested conditions, including the transition between those.
        kwargs: dictionary of keyword arguments for the method chosen.

    Returns:
        increment_inflow method -
        Args:
            vehicles: set of vehicles
            vehid: vehicle ID to be used for next created vehicle

    """Anchors are 'dummy' Vehicles which can be used as placeholders (e.g. at the beginning/end of Lanes).

    Anchors are used at the beginning of Lanes, to maintain vehicle order, so that vehicles will have
    a correct vehicle order upon being added to the start of the lane. Because of anchors, it is not
    possible for vehicles to have None as a fol/lfol/rfol attribute (unless the left/right lane don't exist).
    Anchors can also be used at the end of the lanes, e.g. to simulate vehicles needing to stop because
    of a traffic light or because the lane ends.
    All Lanes have an anchor attribute which is an AnchorVehicle at the start of the Lanes' track. A track
    is a continuous series of lanes such that a vehicle can travel on all the constituent lanes without
    performing any lane changes (i.e. the end of any lane in the track connects to the start of the next
    lane in the track). Therefore comparing Lane's anchors can also be used to compare their tracks.
    Compared to Vehicles, Anchors don't have a cf or lc model, have much fewer attributes, and don't have
    any methods which update their attributes.
