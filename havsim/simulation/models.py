houses all the different models for simulation

for models, we want to create some sort of way to modularly build models. For example,
circular/straight roads have different headway calculations, or optionally add or exclude things like 
bounds on velocity/acceleration, or extra regimes, or have something like 
random noise added or not. 

Something like a wrapper function which can accept different parts and combine them into one single thing

models should have the following call signature: 
    veh - list of state of vehicle model is being applied to
    lead - list of state for vehicle's leader
    p - parameters
    leadlen - length of lead vehicle
    *args - additional inputs should be stored in modelinfo dict, and passed through *args
    dt = .1 - timestep 
    
    they return the derivative of the state i.e. how to update in the next timestep
