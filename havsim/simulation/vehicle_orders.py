    We keep each vehicle's left/right followers updated by doing a single distance compute each timestep.
    The current way of dealing with l/r followers is designed for timesteps which are relatively small.
    (e.g. .1 or .25 seconds) where we also keep l/rfol updated at all timesteps. Other strategies would be
    better for larger timesteps or if l/rfol don't need to always be updated. See block comment
    above update_change to discuss alternative strategies for defining leader/follower relationships.

    Called in simulation by update_all_lrfol.
    update_all_lrfol_multiple can be used to handle edge cases so that the vehicle order is always correct,

######### lfol/rfol/llead/rlead explanation
# explanation of why leader follower relationships are designed this way (i.e. why we have lfol/llead etc.)
# in current logic, main cost per timestep is just one distance compute in update_lrfol
# whenever there is a lane change, there are a fair number of extra updates we have to do to keep all
# of the rlead/llead updated. Also, whenever an lfol/rfol changes, there are two rlead/lead attributes
# that need to be changed as well. Thus this strategy is very efficient assuming we want to keep lfol/rfol
# updated (call lc every timestep), lane changes aren't super common, and all vehicles travel at around
# the same speed. (which are all reasonable assumptions)

# naive way would be having to do something like keep a sorted list, every time we want lfol/rfol
# we have to do log(n) dist computes, where n is the number of vehicles in the current lane.
# whenever a vehicle changes lanes, you need to remove from the current list and add to the new,
# so it is log(n) dist computations + 2n for searching/updating the 2 lists.
# Thus the current implementation is definitely much better than the naive way.

# Another option you could do is to only store lfol/rfol, to keep it updated you would have to
# do 2 dist calculations per side per timestep (do a call of leadfol find where we already have either
# a follower or leader as guess). When there is a lane change store a dict which has the lane changing
# vehicle as a key, and store as the value the new guess to use. You would need to use this dict to update
# guesses whenever it is time to update the lfol/rfol. Updating guesses efficiently is the challenge here.
# This strategy would have higher costs per timestep to keep lfol/rfol updated, but would be simpler to
# update when there is a lane change. Thus it might be more efficient if the number of timesteps is small
# relative to the number of lane changes.
# Because you don't need the llead/rlead in this option, you also can avoid fully updating l/rfol every
# timestep, although you would need to check if your l/rfol had a lane change, but that operation
# just checks for a hash value or compares anchor vehicles, which is less expensive than a get_dist call.

# More generally, the different strategies (always updating lead/fol relationships, having l/rlead or not)
# can be combined. If you don't need l/rlead, then there is no reason to keep it updated (or even have it).
# likewise, if you don't need to always have the lead/fol updated every timestep, there is no reason to
# keep it updated. On the other hand, if you need more than just the lfol/rfol, perhaps those should
# kept updated as well.
# TODO optimizing the vehicle orders can be done in the future when it is more clear exactly what information
# is needed at each timestep.
