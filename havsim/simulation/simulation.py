"""Houses the main logic for updating simulations.

A simulation is defined by a collection of lanes/roads (a road network) and an initial
collection of vehicles. The road network defines both the network topology (i.e. how roads connect
with each other) as well as the inflow/outflow boundary conditions, which determine how
vehicles enter/leave the simulation. The inflow conditions additionally control what types of
vehicles enter the simulation. Vehicles are implemented in the Vehicle class and a road network
is made up of instances of the Lane class.

    """Updates all quantities for a road network.

    The simulation logics are as follows. At the beginning of the timestep, all vehicles/states/events
    are assumed to be fully updated for the current timestep. Then, in order:
        -evaluate the longitudinal action (cf model) for all vehicles (done in Simulation.step)
        -evaluation the latitudinal action (lc model) for all vehicles (done in Simulation.step)
        -complete requested lane changes
            -move vehicle to the new lane and set its new route/lane events
            -updating all leader/follower relationships (including l/rfol) for all vehicles involved. This
            means updating vehicles in up to 4 lanes (opside, self lane, lcside, and new lcside).
            -apply relaxation to any vehicles as necessary
        -update all states and memory for all vehicles
        -update headway for all vehicles
        -update any merge anchors
        -updating lane/route events for all vehicles, including removing vehicles if they leave the network.
        -update all lfol/rfol relationships
        -update the inflow conditions for all lanes with inflow, including possible adding new vehicles,
            and generating the parameters for the next new vehicle
    After the updating is complete, all vehicles/states/events are updated to their values for the next
    timestep, so when the time index is incremented, the iteration can continue.

    Args:
        vehicles: set containing all vehicle objects being actively simulated
        lc_actions: dictionary with keys as vehicles which request lane changes in the current timestep,
            values are a string either 'l' or 'r' which indicates the side of the change
        inflow_lanes: iterable of lanes which have upstream (inflow) boundary conditions. These lanes
            must have get_inflow, increment_inflow, and new_vehicle methods
        merge_lanes: iterable of lanes which have merge anchors. These lanes must have a merge_anchors
            attribute
        vehid: int giving the unique vehicle ID for the next vehicle to be generated
