in the main folder are the main scripts which were used to generate data/results 
which were used in the adjoint and relaxation paper. 
the results are saved in pkl files which are located in one drive > important misc > datasets > pickle 
or something like that. 
in folder figures are the scripts that were used to generate tables/figures for the papers. 

There are also many random scripts, which are in misc and useful misc. 
in misc there are miscalanneous scripts, mainly things for testing/debugging purposes. 
probalby everythign in misc is useless
any scripts we thought might be useful (other than the ones in main and figures) are in useful misc.
we have recorded in that file the bounds/guesses we empirically found to work well 
for calibration.
